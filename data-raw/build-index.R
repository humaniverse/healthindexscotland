# ---- Method ----
# The build method is adapated from the methods used to develop the Health Index
# for England. As the devolved nations versions of the Health Index are not
# measured across time, several aspects of the construction differ, and mirror
# those found in the Indices of Multiple Deprivation.

# Steps:
#   1. Scale (align) indicators so that higher value = worse health to align
#      with the other resilience indices (higher = worse).
#   2. Missing step: Apply functional transformations (e.g. log, square) to
#      address skewness in the distributions.
#   3. Normalise to mean of 0 and SD +-1 and then apply MFLA.
#   4. Optional step: Weight the indicators within domains: apply MFLA.
#   5. Calculate domain scores: add together normalised indicator scores
#      (weighted or unweighted) and rank and qunatise.
#   6. Combine domains with equal weighting to produce composite score: rank
#      and quantise output.
